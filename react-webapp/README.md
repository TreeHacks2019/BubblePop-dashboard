# ArcGIS JS API 4.x / React / Redux Boilerplate

Web scene viewer boilerplate web application using React and Redux, including the ArcGIS JS API
as middleware. The example application displays a web scene with a simple sun position slider.

## Features

This boilerplate example integrates:

* [ArcGIS JS API 4.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [Calcite Web](http://esri.github.io/calcite-web/)

It provides two useful Redux
[middleware](https://medium.com/@jacobp100/you-arent-using-redux-middleware-enough-94ffe991e6) examples:

* [arcgis-authentication](/src/middleware/arcgis-authentication.js) - handles Portal login.
* [arcgis-sceneview](/src/middleware/arcgis-sceneview.js) - opens a SceneView with a WebScene, handle selection, and environment changes.

It provides support for:

* [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - You can browse
  the state and dispatch actions live while the application is running.
* [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) - Updated
  **components** or **reducers** are automatically replaced while the application is running.
  The state is preserved during updates, and the SceneView does not need to be reloaded.
* Tests with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html).

## Instructions

### Installing

Download the repository and install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

### Registering your App

For this code to work, you need to
[add](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/add-item-to-agol.htm) and
[register](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/register-app.htm) an app in ArcGIS Online,
add the correct redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`), and add the App ID to [/src/constants/app-constants.js](/src/constants/app-constants.js).

* [How to add an app in ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/add-item-to-agol.htm)
* [How to register an app in ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/register-app.htm)
* Make sure to set the correct redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`)

Finally, update [/src/constants/app-constants.js](/src/constants/app-constants.js) to contain your App ID (and portal URL if not ArcGIS Online):

```javascript
export const APP_ID = '<insert App ID here>';
export const APP_PORTAL_URL = 'https://www.arcgis.com';
```

### Running

Run tests:

```
$ npm test
```

Build and run live server:

```
$ npm start
```
